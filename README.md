# TeaCozy
Tea Cozy Mockup

In this project, I will create a fictional tea shop website on my own computer.

A design spec and image assets have been provided to help me along the way.

A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values.
These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer.
This project assumes that I will be able to reproduce the basic HTML and CSS with little guidance.
